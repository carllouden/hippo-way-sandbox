Cycle to Work is a government initiative which offers the most cost-effective way to get new cycling equipment. It means you do not have to pay tax or  national insurance. The reduced cost is then simply deducted out of your payslip over 12, 24 or 36 months. Our cycle to work scheme is through Green Commute.

### Who is eligible for the scheme?

All permanent hippos, once they have been employed for six months.

### How do I apply?

1. Have a look at bikes in your preferred shop and decide which you'd like to purchase
2. Notify the People team inbox that you wish to proceed. A member of the team will send you a form to e-sign
3. Go to the green commute website and submit your quote. When submitting your quote, there are three sections to complete: 'about you', 'about your employer' and 'about your bike'. You will also be asked to complete a salary sacrifice form. Once everything is complete, you will be provided with an invoice
4. Send the invoice and salary sacrifice form to [accounts@hippodigital.co.uk](mailto:accounts@hippodigital.co.uk)
5. Once everything has been checked over by the team, a voucher will be emailed to your hippo email address. You can then use this voucher to purchase your bike.

### What if I leave?

Any outstanding costs will be deducted from your final pay. rytgrgrtgtrgrtgrtgt
