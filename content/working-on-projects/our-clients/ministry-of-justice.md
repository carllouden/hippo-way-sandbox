### Current Live Projects

#### RP/ARNS

On average, 900 people are released from prison each week. For the best chance at a crime-free life, individuals exiting prison require adequate housing, employment opportunities, healthcare, and financial support for successful community reintegration.

The Resettlement Passport was initiated in a Prisons Strategy White Paper, where the requirement was to develop an app for prison leavers to manage their transition into the community after leaving prison.

ARNS (Assess Risks, Needs and Strengths) will replace the OASys (Offender Assessment System) with a modern, modular and user-centred service, that brings together all assessments and plans, enables better data sharing, and supports role-based access, version control and smoother workflows.
